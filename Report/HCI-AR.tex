\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}

\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
\DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}




% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) represents a nuanced and interdisciplinary domain that intricately 
investigates the symbiotic relationship between humans and computer systems, with a primary focus on optimizing the design 
and utilization of technological interfaces. At its core, HCI delves into the intricacies of how individuals interact with 
computing devices, aiming to refine and elevate these interactions to levels of heightened effectiveness, efficiency, and 
overall user satisfaction.


Hand gesture recognition plays a significant role in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by providing a natural and intuitive means 
for users to interact with computers and devices. The relationship between hand gesture recognition and HCI lies in the application 
of gesture-based interfaces to enhance the way users communicate with and control technology. 

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital information and virtual objects on the real-world environment, 
creating an augmented view for users. Unlike virtual reality, which immerses users in a completely computer-generated environment, 
augmented reality enhances the real-world environment by adding computer-generated perceptual information.

The relationship between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Augmented Reality (AR) is profound, as AR technologies heavily 
rely on effective HCI principles to deliver immersive and user-friendly experiences. Some of their interconnection aspects can 
be noted as User Interface and User Experience Design, Motion and Gesture Interaction, Spatial Awareness, Usability in 3D space, 
Feedback and user guidance, Context-Aware Computing, Accessibility in AR.

In recent years, the integration of cutting-edge technologies has propelled Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to new heights, 
revolutionizing the way users engage with digital content. One captivating synergy within this realm lies at the intersection 
of Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) and Marker-Based Augmented Reality (AR). This amalgamation presents a promising frontier for 
creating intuitive and immersive interactive experiences, where users can seamlessly navigate and manipulate augmented environments 
through natural hand gestures.

Hand gesture recognition, a pivotal facet of HCI, enables users to communicate with computing systems using natural and instinctive 
movements. Leveraging advanced computer vision algorithms, these systems interpret and respond to the intricacies of hand gestures, 
introducing an unparalleled level of intuitiveness to human-computer interactions. Concurrently, Marker-Based Augmented Reality 
employs identifiable markers, such as QR codes or images, as triggers to overlay digital content onto the physical world. 
This technology augments reality by blending virtual elements with the user's immediate environment.

The convergence of hand gesture recognition and marker-based AR holds great promise for advancing the field of HCI. By integrating 
gesture recognition into AR interfaces, users can interact with digital content in a manner that mirrors real-world actions, 
fostering a more intuitive and engaging experience. This marriage of technologies addresses the limitations of traditional input methods, 
offering a more natural, efficient, and hands-free mode of interaction within augmented environments.

This paper explores the synergy between hand gesture recognition and marker-based AR, examining the implications for user interface 
design, interactive applications, and the overall user experience. We delve into the technical intricacies of combining these 
technologies, exploring how gesture-driven interactions can enhance the usability and accessibility of marker-based AR systems. 
Moreover, we investigate the potential impact on diverse application domains, from gaming and education to industrial training and 
collaborative workspaces.

As we navigate through the intricate landscape of this technological convergence, we seek to unravel the synergies and challenges 
that arise when marrying hand gesture recognition with marker-based AR. By doing so, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse 
in HCI, providing insights that inform the design and development of more natural and immersive interfaces for augmented reality environments. 
The journey into this fusion promises to unlock novel possibilities, shaping the future landscape of interactive technologies and user experiences.










% === II. Planned Methods ========================
% =================================================================================
\section{Planned Methods and Tools}


\subsection*{1. Landmark Detection}
Landmark detection, also known as keypoint detection, refers to the process of identifying and locating specific points or 
features within an image or a visual scene. These points are often distinctive and can be used as references or landmarks 
for various computer vision tasks. Landmark detection is a crucial step in understanding and analyzing images, enabling applications 
in fields such as facial recognition, pose estimation, object tracking, and augmented reality \cite{lin2021ego2hands}.

MediaPipe utilizes a specific model called the MediaPipe Hands for hand tracking, including hand landmark detection. 
The algorithm for hand landmark detection in MediaPipe Hands is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.

The hand landmark model in MediaPipe can detect and track 21 3D landmarks on each hand, including key points such as the tips 
of the fingers, the base of the palm, and points along the hand contours. This enables precise tracking and recognition of hand 
gestures in real-time video or image streams.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{photo/hand-landmarks.png}
  The list of detected point of the hand by landmark hand detector.
  \caption{Landmark hand gesture detected joints}
  \label{fig_sim}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{2. ArUco markers}

ArUco markers are a type of augmented reality marker designed for computer vision applications, particularly for tasks such as 
camera calibration and augmented reality (AR) systems. These markers are black-and-white square patterns that are easy to detect 
and identify in images or video frames. using markers we are able to detect critical points in an video stream frame, generally, 
markers are used for Visual Pattern Recognition, Unique identification, camera calibration and etc. 

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) provides a dedicated module for ArUco marker detection, and the implementation is 
based on the ArUco library. The ArUco module in OpenCV is specifically designed for easy integration of ArUco markers into 
computer vision applications.

\subsection*{3. Homography Finding}

To estimate the transformation matrix (homography matrix) that relates corresponding points in two images of the same scene. OpenCV
offers builtin homography detection methods that can be used for perspective point matching between real image and the way of residing 
in the the parent image visible area.

\begin{figure}[!t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1.5in]{photo/aruco-markers.png}
  Sample chart of ArUco Markers.
  \caption{ArUco Markers}
  \label{fig_sim}
\end{figure}

\section{Expected Results}

The expected result of landmark-based hand gesture detection combined with augmented reality (AR) can be a dynamic and interactive 
user experience where real-world hand movements are used to control and interact with virtual elements. 
Here's an overview of the potential outcomes:
\subsection*{Real-Time Hand Gesture Detection}
Accurate and real-time detection of hand gestures using landmarks provides a natural and intuitive way for users to convey commands or 
interact with digital content.
\subsection*{Precise Tracking of Hand Poses}
Landmark detection allows for precise tracking of the positions and orientations of key points on the hand, enabling accurate 
recognition of various hand poses and movements.
\subsection*{Virtual Object Manipulation}
Users can interact with virtual objects overlaid on the real-world environment using their hand gestures. This could include 
grabbing, moving, rotating, or resizing virtual elements.
\subsection*{Gesture-Based Controls}
Hand gestures can serve as a gesture-based control interface for AR applications. For example, a specific gesture might trigger 
an event, change the color or view, or initiate a specific action.
\subsection*{Immersive AR Experiences}
Landmark-based hand gesture detection enhances the immersion of AR experiences by allowing users to engage with the virtual 
content in a more natural and hands-on manner.
\subsection*{Natural Interaction in AR Painting}
In AR painting game, users can control characters or perform in-game actions using hand gestures detected by landmarks. This adds a 
layer of physicality and engagement to the painting experience.
\subsection*{Overall Expectation}
The expected result is an interactive and immersive AR experience where users can use their hands and gestures to 
manipulate digital content, enhancing the naturalness and engagement of human-computer interactions in augmented reality.




% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,

% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the

% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but

\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have explored the synergies of landmark detection, ArUco markers, and hand gesture recognition in the context 
of webcam video streams, leveraging the capabilities of the OpenCV library. The fusion of these technologies has paved the way for 
a multifaceted approach to enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), providing users with a more intuitive and immersive 
experience in real-time video environments.

The integration of landmark detection serves as the backbone of our approach, enabling precise tracking and recognition of 
key points on the human hand and face. This information is then seamlessly combined with the distinctive properties of ArUco markers, 
which act as visual anchors for accurate pose estimation and perspective transformations within the webcam video stream. Together, 
these components form a robust foundation for spatial awareness and object tracking in dynamic scenes.

Adding another layer of sophistication, hand gesture recognition brings a natural and gestural interface to our HCI paradigm. 
The ability to interpret and respond to hand movements in real time enhances the user's ability to interact with digital content 
in an instinctive and hands-on manner. Gestures such as Thumb Up/Down, Like/Unlike, Victory Sign can be translated into meaningful
commands, expanding the range of possibilities for interactive applications within the webcam video stream.

Through our exploration, we have witnessed the potential applications of this fusion across diverse domains. In educational settings, 
users can manipulate 3D models or engage with virtual simulations through hand gestures and markers. In gaming environments, 
the combination of landmark detection and hand gesture recognition provides an immersive and interactive gaming experience. 
Moreover, the integration of ArUco markers facilitates accurate registration of virtual objects within the physical space captured 
by the webcam.

The significance of our approach extends to accessibility considerations, as gestural interfaces offer alternative interaction methods 
for individuals with physical disabilities. Furthermore, the real-time nature of our system enhances its applicability in various contexts, 
from augmented reality to video conferencing, where natural and expressive gestures can convey a richer form of communication.

Looking ahead, the fusion of landmark detection, ArUco markers, and hand gesture recognition in webcam video streams opens avenues 
for further research and development. Improvements in algorithmic efficiency, robustness, and the exploration of deep learning 
techniques may contribute to even more seamless and accurate interactions. Additionally, the integration of haptic feedback or 
voice commands could further enhance the multimodal nature of our HCI system.

In conclusion, our work signifies a step forward in the evolution of interactive experiences within webcam video streams. By combining 
landmark detection, ArUco markers, and hand gesture recognition with OpenCV, we have created a versatile and accessible example 
that empowers users to interact with digital content in a natural and engaging manner. This fusion not only enriches HCI paradigms 
but also paves the way for innovative applications that bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds. As technology continues 
to evolve, so too will the opportunities to redefine how we engage with and perceive the digital landscape.
