  abstract = {Background and Objective
              The research is done in the field of Augmented Reality (AR) for patient positioning in radiation therapy is scarce. We propose an efficient and cost-effective algorithm for tracking the scene and the patient to interactively assist the patient’s positioning process by providing visual feedback to the operator. Up to our knowledge, this is the first framework that can be employed for mobile interactive AR to guide patient positioning.
              Methods
              We propose a pointcloud processing method that, combined with a fiducial marker-mapper algorithm and the generalized ICP algorithm, tracks the patient and the camera precisely and efficiently only using the CPU unit. The 3D reference model and body marker map alignment is calculated employing an efficient body reconstruction algorithm.
              Results
              Our quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves a translational and rotational error of 4.17 mm/0.82∘ at 9 fps. Furthermore, the qualitative results demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm in patient positioning on different human subjects.
              Conclusion
              Since our algorithm achieves a relatively high frame rate and accuracy employing a regular laptop (without a dedicated GPU), it is a very cost-effective AR-based patient positioning method. It also opens the way for other researchers by introducing a framework that could be improved upon for better mobile interactive AR patient positioning solutions in the future.}

As the point of contact with the finger and object changes dynamically, making the problem to have a large degree of variability.This proposal is limited to direct feedback of the object position with respect to the world coordinates and interfacing with the delta robot controlling in real time environment.Detection of markers by three cameras is achieved using ArUco augmented reality library. Experimental results are presented to support the approach in this paper.}

An example of a IEEEtran control entry which can change some IEEEtran.bst
settings. An entry like this must be cited via \bstctlcite{} command
before the first real \cite{}. The same entry key cannot be called twice
(just like multiple \cite{} of the same entry key place only one entry
in the bibliography.)
The available control fields are:

CTLuse_article_number
"no" turns off the display of the number for articles.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_paper
"no" turns off the display of the paper and type fields in inproceedings.
"yes" enables

CTLuse_forced_etal 
"no" turns off the forced use of "et al."
"yes" enables

CTLmax_names_forced_etal
The maximum number of names that can be present beyond which an "et al."
usage is forced. Be sure that CTLnames_show_etal (below)
is not greater than this value!

CTLnames_show_etal
The number of names that will be shown with a forced "et al.".
Must be less than or equal to CTLmax_names_forced_etal

CTLuse_alt_spacing 
"no" turns off the alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs.
"yes" enables

CTLalt_stretch_factor
If alternate interword spacing for entries with URLs is enabled, this is
the interword spacing stretch factor that will be used. For example, the
default "4" here means that the interword spacing in entries with URLs can
stretch to four times normal. Does not have to be an integer.

CTLdash_repeated_names
"no" turns off the "dashification" of repeated (i.e., identical to those
of the previous entry) names. IEEE normally does this.
"yes" enables

CTLname_format_string
The name format control string as explained in the BibTeX style hacking
guide.
IEEE style "{f.~}{vv~}{ll}{, jj}" is the default,

CTLname_latex_cmd
A LaTeX command that each name will be fed to (e.g., "\textsc").
Leave empty if no special font is desired for the names.
The default is empty.

CTLname_url_prefix
The prefix text used before URLs.
The default is "[Online]. Available:" A space will be inserted after this
text. If this space is not wanted, just use \relax at the end of the
prefix text.


Those fields that are not to be changed can be left out.
